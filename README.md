# Dynamic-User-Profile-Management-Application
Built with the MERN Stack

This web application offers an interactive and user-friendly experience for managing user profiles.

**Welcome Animation**: The homepage features a dynamic, moveable "Welcome" message. Clicking on it leads users to the main form.

**User Form**: The form includes fields for Name, Email, and Image URL, along with a Submit button.

**Profile Display**: Upon submission, the user's profile is displayed with their image, name, and email.

**Update & Delete Functionality:**
Update: Users can modify their profile details by clicking the Update button, which reopens the form for editing.
Delete: The Delete button allows users to permanently remove their profile.
This project demonstrates my ability to create responsive, CRUD-based web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It highlights a seamless user experience, dynamic state management, and robust backend integration.
